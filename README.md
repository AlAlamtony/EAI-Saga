1. Orchestrator Logic
 This part implements a centralized Saga orchestrator that coordinates all the steps of the transaction:

Steps:
 Create an order in the e-commerce system.
 Process payment in the Stripe system.
 Create an accounting record.
 Update inventory in the warehouse system.
 Error Handling: The orchestrator includes a rollback mechanism to undo operations in case of failures.
 API Simulations: Each transaction step is simulated using placeholder methods.
 This approach is centralized and suitable for systems requiring tight control over the workflow 
 The provided code is a Java implementation of a Saga Orchestrator, a design pattern used for managing distributed transactions. This specific implementation simulates an e-commerce workflow where multiple systems are involved in processing a user order. Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

1. Overview of the Code
The OrderSagaOrchestrator class orchestrates a saga for managing a user's order by performing a sequence of operations:

Create an order in the e-commerce system.
Process a payment through a simulated Stripe API.
Record the transaction in an accounting system.
Update the inventory in the warehouse system.
If any step fails, it initiates a rollback to undo all previously completed operations.

2. Key Components of the Code
2.1 startSaga(OrderRequest orderRequest)
Purpose: This is the main method that coordinates the steps of the saga.
Workflow:
Calls createOrder() to create the user's order.
Calls createPayment() to process the payment.
Calls createAccountingRecord() to log the transaction in the accounting system.
Calls updateInventory() to update the stock in the warehouse.
Error Handling:
If any step fails (throws an exception), the catch block handles the failure by invoking rollbackTransactions().
2.2 Helper Methods for Transactions
Each helper method represents a local transaction performed by a system:

createOrder(OrderRequest orderRequest):

Simulates an API call to create an order in the e-commerce system.
Returns a random UUID as the order ID.
createPayment(OrderRequest orderRequest, String orderId):

Simulates an API call to process the payment via Stripe.
Returns a random UUID as the payment ID.
createAccountingRecord(OrderRequest orderRequest, String orderId):

Simulates an API call to create an accounting record for the transaction.
Returns a random UUID as the accounting record ID.
updateInventory(OrderRequest orderRequest):

Simulates an API call to update the inventory in the warehouse.
Returns a random UUID as the inventory update ID.
Each of these methods is a placeholder for actual API integrations.

2.3 rollbackTransactions(OrderRequest orderRequest)
Purpose: Simulates rolling back the operations if any transaction fails.
Workflow:
Prints rollback messages for each step to indicate that previously completed actions are being undone.
Simulated Logic: In a real system, this method would contain API calls to reverse actions like canceling an order or refunding a payment.
2.4 OrderRequest Class
Represents the request details for an order.
Fields:
userId: The ID of the user placing the order.
productId: The ID of the product being purchased.
quantity: The quantity of the product being ordered.
Constructor: Initializes the fields with the values provided.
2.5 main(String[] args)
This is the entry point of the program.
Creates an Order Request:
OrderRequest orderRequest = new OrderRequest("user123", "product456", 1);
Represents a user (user123) purchasing one unit of product product456.
Starts the Saga:
orchestrator.startSaga(orderRequest);
Executes the saga for the given order request.
